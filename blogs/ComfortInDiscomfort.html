        <h1>5. Comfort in Discomfort</h1>
        <span class="date">26/03/2023</span>
        <br />
        <p>
            I have observed myself in the past few weeks.
            Whenever I come across anything that is remotely uncomfortable,
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
            <li>effort wise</li>
            <li>or difficult to accept truths</li>
            <li>or just something I don't agree with</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
            I find myself trying to get busy with something else.
            Never actually sitting and trying to <em>process</em> the discomfort.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            I would cook or watch a series or do something to distract myself.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Like for example: Literally right now, I am writing about this because I don't want to think about something
            which makes me anxious.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Maybe that's life? Maybe finding <em>comfort in discomfort</em> is the ultimate goal of life?
            Maybe that's what moving on means?
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            I don't know. Nuff' said. I'll go back to writing assignments for now...
