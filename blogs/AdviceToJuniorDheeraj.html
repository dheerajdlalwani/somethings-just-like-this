      <br />
      <p>
        You are now in 1st/2nd year you think that you have figured what you
        like or maybe you are still in the phase of figuring what you like...
        That's okay. Be patient with yourself. Tu kuch na kuch to kar hi lega
        life me.
        <br />
        <br />
        At this stage, experiment with anything and everything but give a
        genuine attempt to whatever you try. You've heard it before and I'll say
        it again, do not jump on the hype train and just do something because a
        lot of people are doing it.
        <br />
        <br />
        But yes, when you ARE doing something, reaching out to people who are
        balls deep into it or even people who have ventured into it and switched
        to something else for whatever reason can be a HUGE help. You get
        different perspectives from different people but at the end, the
        decision should be yours.
        <br />
        <br />
        Do not ever self-reject yourself from anything just solely on the basis
        of what you feel you can achieve. The regret of self-rejection hurts
        more than someone else rejecting you. I have experienced that and I am
        still in someways experiencing that.
        <br />
        <br />
        I will take an example here: However, this is just an example and is
        applicable everywhere. Lets say there is some club and you wanted to be
        a part of it but you were self-doubting yourself whether you will get in
        or not be able to keep up with the work. Just apply. Get into those
        uncomfortable situations. They will help you grow.
        <br />
        <br />
        Another example: When you apply for a job/internship. Don't give up
        because YOU feel that you are not good enough. At this stage, you don't
        know jack shit about yourself. This is the time when you learn about
        yourself.
        <br />
        <br />
        Just learn to say NO. I have failed to say NO just because the person
        I'm communicating with will feel bad or they are a good friend of mine
        and I didn't want to give up on them. A rule of thumb: You need to
        respect your time first and everything else comes later.
        <br />
        <br />
        Once again, tell yourself that you are going to be fine and you will
        figure it out sooner or later.
        <br />
        <br />
        You were lucky enough to meet one of the best, humble, down to Earth,
        honest and trustworthy; God gifted friend/mentor/brother. Be thankful to
        him. He has helped you shape yourself in ways you cannot imagine. Yes,
        I'm talking about none other than Harsh Kapadia.
        <br />
        <br />
        Lastly, just believe in yourself and compete with yourself rather than
        others.
