      <h1>3. Life Lessons From Adversity</h1>
      <span class="date">24/02/2022</span>
      <br />
      <p>
        In the last few hours, I've seen adversity, I wouldn't wish upon my
        worst enemy. I will not get into the details of what happened
        (everything is better now and I'm okay^), but it did come with a few
        invaluable life lessons. I'll try to document them below.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Family.</h2>
      <p>
        When it comes on your family, nothing else matters. No matter how
        important it is. No matter how excited you were for something else or
        how important that other thing was. Family is all. Yes, it's not just
        any quote from <em>Breaking Bad</em>. I felt this one.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Patience.</h2>
      <p>
        Patience will eventually lead you to outcomes you couldn't have
        imagined. It genuinely seems like a miracle. You have to be patient,
        extra patient with elders, especially with ones who are sick. You have
        to put yourself in that person's shoes.
        <em>Sabr ka phal sach me meetha hota hai.</em>
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Emotional Strength.</h2>
      <p>
        Having emotional strength is underrated. In the state of an emergency,
        when there is no one to help you and someone is dependant on you to take
        care of them, making sure they are alright. You have to stay strong,
        make sure the person who is dependant on you is alright and comfort
        them. Make them understand that you are there for them and everything is
        going to be fine.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Money.</h2>
      <p>
        Times of adversity makes us realize the importance of financial
        planning. Please, please take some time out and educate yourself about
        personal finances (hypocrite alert^ I am yet to do it.), mediclaim,
        health insurance and long term savings. Emergency comes without any
        warnings and does not discriminate between rich and poor. But when it
        strikes, have some capital really helps with the 1000x mental burden due
        to the emergency.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Work in progress.</h2>
      <p>
        This article is a work in progress. I'm learning more and more lessons
        everyday. I'll keep adding them here as and when I get time.
