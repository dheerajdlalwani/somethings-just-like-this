      <h1>3. Life Lessons From Adversity</h1>
      <span class="date">24/02/2022</span>
      <br />
      <p>
        In the last few hours, I've seen adversity, I wouldn't wish upon my
        worst enemy. I will not get into the details of what happened
        (everything is better now and I'm okay^), but it did come with a few
        invaluable life lessons. I'll try to document them below.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Family.</h2>
      <p>
        When it comes on your family, nothing else matters. No matter how
        important it is. No matter how excited you were for something else or
        how important that other thing was. Family is all. Yes, it's not just
        any quote from <em>Breaking Bad</em>. I felt this one.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Patience.</h2>
      <p>
        Patience will eventually lead you to outcomes you couldn't have
        imagined. It genuinely seems like a miracle. You have to be patient,
        extra patient with elders, especially with ones who are sick. You have
        to put yourself in that person's shoes.

      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Emotional Strength.</h2>
      <p>
        Having emotional strength is underrated. In the state of an emergency,
        when there is no one to help you and someone is dependant on you to take
        care of them, making sure they are alright. You have to stay strong,
        make sure the person who is dependant on you is alright and comfort
        them. Make them understand that you are there for them and everything is
        going to be fine.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Work in progress.</h2>
      <p>
        This article is a work in progress. I'm learning more and more lessons
        everyday. I'll keep adding them here as and when I get time.
