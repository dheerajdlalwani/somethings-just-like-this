    <h1>1. The girl from the doctor's office</h1>
    <span class="date">26/06/2023</span>
    <br />
    <p>
      I don't remember the specifics of it much because I was highly sedated by her beauty... or because I was on a
      shitload of painkillers for my broken arm.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      But boy, was she a sight for sore eyes.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      I vaguely remember her appearance.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      She sat there, with her legs crossed, immersed in her Harry Potter novel. She wore a sky-blue <i>kurti</i> and
      skin-fit jeans which made me fall for her, faster than a free-falling body in a vacuum.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      "Who is this mystery girl? Why was she at the doctor's office? Was she in pain? Is she sick?" I wondered.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      "Ms. Ishika, you're next. Please proceed to the cabin.", the receptionist announced.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Woah, her name is Ishika. "What a beautiful name!", I thought, as she put down her book in her bag and hurried
      into the examination room.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      "You have a crush, Mr. Broken Bones", chuckled my sister as I looked at Ishika walk by into the cabin.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      "Stop it. I do not have a crush on her."
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      "She looked pretty in that sky-blue <em>kurti</em>>," I said, trying to hide my pink, blushing cheeks. It felt as
      if her love potion had completely intoxicated me.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      "So, are you going to ask her out on a date? Or are you going to chicken out like always?" asked my sister with
      the cutest, starry hopeful eyes ever.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      I've never had much luck with the girls. In fact, I've never been on a date before. Opportunities have been
      chasing me, but I've always been faster. Am I just too naïve to understand? Or perhaps I wasn't ready before? I
      don't know. But something felt different, that day.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      "I don't know, maybe. Please don't go around making a big deal out of it, okay? I'm shy and scared enough by the
      mere existence of your species already okay?" I replied, annoyingly. "We're not monsters, you dummy. All you need
      to do is approach us gracefully. That's it. Com'on, don't be shy!"
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      "Alright. I'll try." I said.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      The receptionist announced, "Mr. Dheeraj, you're next, please proceed to the cabin." "Thank God," I told myself as
      I walked towards the cabin when she walked out. We exchanged an awkward smile as I hurried away into the cabin. I
      screamed at myself internally for blowing off another opportunity.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      My sister waited outside, reading a magazine while I got my arm all checked out. I wondered, "Why am I like this?
      Why can't I strike up a single conversation?" while the doctor cut open my plaster and got me prepped for an
      x-ray. My hand still needed some mending so I got a new plaster fixed up. The doctor and I chatted for a while
      about my career and then I stepped out.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      I couldn't believe my eyes after seeing what I saw as I walked outside with my jaw dropped.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      There was my sister, laughing and giggling and chatting with Ishika. "Have you met Dheeraj?", she asked Ishika as
      she turned towards me. "He also is a software engineer. He works at SomeBigCorp. You two might have a lot to talk
      about!"
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      That's when my sister became my best wingman! I smiled at my sister and mimed a huge "THANK YOU" to her as I and
      Ishika parted ways with my sister. That's how I met the girl from the doctor's office.
